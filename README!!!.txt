Tictactoe is a game, made by Ishan Sandeep Kshirsagar, a student of SCOE, Pune who is a basic level Python coder.

**TO GET STARTED**

1) Make sure you've downloaded all of these 6 files :
  __pycache__ , OST, Sprites, README!!!.txt, Tictactoe.pyc, Tictactoe.exe

2) Just run the "Tictactoe.exe" file, and start playing :)

**HOW TO PLAY**

This version of the game supports ONLY Keyboard inputs, NOT mouse inputs. The key bindings of the Number Pad 
correspond to the respective Block Position, i.e, 
      |      |      
 num7 | num8 | num9 
______|______|______
      |      |      
 num4 | num5 | num6 
______|______|______
      |      |      
 num1 | num2 | num3 
      |      |      
EXAMPLE = If you want to put an "X" or an "O" in the top left corner, press "7" on your numpad.
EXAMPLE = If you want to put an "X" or an "O" in the right middle block, press "6" on your numpad.
          and so on...

**IMPORTANT MESSAGE**

This version of the game does not support Single Player (i.e, vs Computer) mode yet. It will be released as 
soon as possible.
